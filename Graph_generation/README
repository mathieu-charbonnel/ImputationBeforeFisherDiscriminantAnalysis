The main function is graphs.py
graphs.py calls printing1graph.py several times.
printing1graph.py requires accuracy.py and datagen.py

myLDA.py and myLinearModelBase.py are the official python 
functions modified to test the conditional imputation and 
so are required only for this kind of imputation.

imputation_decision.py is used to choose the best imputation 
method so will appear only in graphs which show the line "optimal imputation"

data_extractor.py and real_life_data.py are used only to obtain graphs 
on our banknote dataset
