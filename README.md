# Imputation before LDA classification
This repository aims at testing and comparing several imputation methods before performing LDA classification.
## Description
We run our experiments on 2 datasets. The first one is a data banknote authentification dataset containing four numerical features and a binary class.
The second is simply generated by sampling from 2 multivariate gaussian distributions.
The nature of the covariance matrices as well as the dimension (number of features) can be defined via command line arguments, as well as the missingness probability and the type of missingness (see acknowledgment for details on those).
The imputation methods that get tested are "Grand Mean", "Conditional Mean", "Nearest Neighbour", "Regression".
The concept of conditional mean is described in the pdf file (not available now), along with the description of my experiments and conclusion.
