The main function is generate_graphs.py
It calls printing1graph.py several times.
printing1graph.py requires accuracy.py and datagen.py

myLDA.py and myLinearModelBase.py enable conditional imputation.
Imputation_decision.py is used to choose the best imputation 
method so will appear only in graphs which show the line "optimal imputation"

data_extractor.py and real_life_data.py are used only to obtain graphs 
on our banknote dataset
